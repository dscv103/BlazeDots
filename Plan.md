# BlazeDots CI Improvements and Performance Optimization Plan

## Executive Summary

This document outlines a comprehensive plan for improving CI performance and implementing optimizations for the BlazeDots NixOS configuration repository. The focus is on reducing build times, improving resource utilization, and enhancing developer experience while maintaining reliability.

## Current State Analysis

### Existing CI Architecture

**Workflows:**
- `nix-ci.yml`: Main CI with flake checks, formatting validation, and basic caching
- `nixos-build.yml`: Matrix builds for all NixOS configurations with artifact generation
- `flake-update-lock.yml`: Automated dependency updates with optional validation
- `copilot-setup-steps.yml`: Comprehensive setup and validation for Copilot integration

**Performance Characteristics:**
- Build matrix strategy for different NixOS configurations
- Basic Nix store caching in nix-ci.yml (cache hit rate: ~70-80% estimated)
- Manual artifact generation (.nar exports)
- Sequential workflow execution in most cases
- No build time tracking or performance metrics

**Current Bottlenecks:**
1. **Cache Inefficiency**: Limited cache sharing between workflows
2. **Resource Utilization**: No parallelization in single-host builds
3. **Build Redundancy**: Duplicate evaluations across workflows
4. **Monitoring Gaps**: No performance metrics or build time tracking
5. **Storage Overhead**: Large artifact uploads without compression optimization

### Technology Stack
- **Nix**: Unstable channel with flakes enabled
- **Caching**: GitHub Actions cache + optional Cachix (disabled)
- **Formatting**: treefmt-nix with nixfmt-rfc-style and prettier
- **Linting**: statix, deadnix integration
- **Build System**: flake-parts modular architecture

## Improvement Goals

### Primary Objectives
1. **Reduce CI execution time by 40-60%**
   - Current estimated time: 8-12 minutes per workflow
   - Target: 5-7 minutes per workflow
2. **Improve cache hit rates to 85-90%**
3. **Implement comprehensive performance monitoring**
4. **Enhance workflow reliability and error recovery**

### Secondary Objectives
1. **Optimize resource consumption**
2. **Improve developer feedback cycle**
3. **Add security scanning and vulnerability detection**
4. **Implement smart conditional execution**

## Optimization Strategy

### Phase 1: Caching and Performance (Weeks 1-2)

#### 1.1 Enhanced Caching Strategy
```yaml
# Planned improvements:
- Multi-level caching (Nix store, evaluation cache, build artifacts)
- Cross-workflow cache sharing
- Dependency-based cache invalidation
- Compressed cache storage
```

**Implementation:**
- Implement shared cache keys across workflows
- Add evaluation result caching for flake metadata
- Optimize cache restore/save timing
- Add cache hit rate reporting

#### 1.2 Build Parallelization
- Parallel flake evaluation where safe
- Concurrent artifact generation
- Parallel linting and formatting checks
- Matrix build optimization

#### 1.3 Smart Conditional Execution
```bash
# Only build affected configurations
- path: "hosts/blazar/**" → build: blazar
- path: "modules/**" → build: all configurations
- path: "docs/**" → skip: nixos builds
```

### Phase 2: Monitoring and Observability (Week 3)

#### 2.1 Performance Metrics Collection
- Build time tracking per stage
- Cache hit/miss rates
- Resource utilization monitoring
- Historical performance trending

#### 2.2 Enhanced Error Reporting
- Structured error outputs with context
- Build failure categorization
- Automatic retry logic for transient failures
- Detailed timing breakdowns

### Phase 3: Advanced Optimizations (Week 4)

#### 3.1 Binary Cache Optimization
- Enable Cachix integration with smart caching
- Implement cache warming strategies
- Add cross-repository cache sharing
- Optimize cache pruning policies

#### 3.2 Security and Quality Improvements
- Automated dependency vulnerability scanning
- License compliance checking
- Advanced static analysis integration
- Security policy enforcement

## Implementation Roadmap

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk
- **Cache corruption**: Implement cache validation and recovery
- **Build failures**: Maintain backward compatibility with fallback strategies

### Medium Risk
- **Resource exhaustion**: Monitor and limit parallel execution
- **Network issues**: Add retry logic and offline fallbacks

### Low Risk
- **Tool updates**: Pin versions and gradual migration strategy
- **Configuration drift**: Automated consistency checks

## Success Metrics

### Performance KPIs
1. **Build Time Reduction**: Target 40-60% improvement
   - Current: ~8-12 minutes → Target: ~5-7 minutes
2. **Cache Hit Rate**: Target 85-90% (vs current ~70-80%)
3. **Workflow Success Rate**: Maintain >95% success rate
4. **Resource Utilization**: Optimize CPU/memory usage efficiency

### Quality KPIs
1. **Error Recovery**: <2 minute average resolution time for transient failures
2. **Developer Experience**: <1 minute feedback for common issues
3. **Security Coverage**: 100% dependency scanning coverage
4. **Compliance**: Zero security policy violations
